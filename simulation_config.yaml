#-----------------------------
# Parameters of simulated data.
#
# Note: if you want to rerun the same workflow with NEW data you have to change at least one of the following parameters:
#  * number of bins
#  * read error rate
#  * read length
#
#-----------------------------
 
  # D3: LARGE DATASET
  #ref_size: 85899345920    # size of reference in bytes? 80*2^30 = 80GiB * 4 haplotypes = 320GB
  #number_of_bins: 1024
  #reads_per_genome: 10000      # 10000 * nr_bins * haplotype_count = 40 million reads

  # D2: MID DATASET
  ref_size: 21474836480    # size of reference in bytes? 20*2^30 = 20GiB * 4 haplotypes = 80GB
  number_of_bins: 256
  reads_per_genome: 2000      # 2000 * nr_bins * haplotype_count = 2 million reads

  # D1: SMALL DATASET
  #ref_size: 262144000    # size of reference in bytes? 250*2^20 = 250MiB * 4 haplotypes = 1GB
  #number_of_bins: 64
  #reads_per_genome: 500      # 10000 * nr_bins * haplotype_count = 100k reads

errors_per_read: 5     # number of errors; this is the basis for error rate in an approximate match
read_length: 150

#-----------------------------
# Mason variator parameters.
#
# These have been highered to make sure that there is enough of a difference between the haplotypes in each bin.
# Only if there is a difference between the haplotypes can a read map to multiple haplotypes with a different edit distance.
#-----------------------------

haplotype_count: 4
snp_rate: 0.01
small_indel_rate: 0.001

# boolean variable to divide similar haplotypes between different bins
