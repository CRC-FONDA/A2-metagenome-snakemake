#-----------------------------
# Parameters of simulated data.
#
# Note: if you want to rerun the same workflow with NEW data you have to change at least one of the following parameters:
#  * number of bins
#  * read error rate
#  * read length
#
#-----------------------------

ref_size: 375809638400    # size of reference in bytes? 350*2^30 = 350GiB
number_of_bins: 1024
errors_per_read: 5     # number of errors; this is the basis for error rate in an approximate match
read_length: 150
reads_per_genome: 10000        # 10000 * nr_bins * haplotype_count = query_size

#-----------------------------
# Mason variator parameters.
#
# These have been highered to make sure that there is enough of a difference between the haplotypes in each bin.
# Only if there is a difference between the haplotypes can a read map to multiple haplotypes with a different edit distance.
#-----------------------------

haplotype_count: 4
snp_rate: 0.01
small_indel_rate: 0.001

# boolean variable to divide similar haplotypes between different bins
mix_bins: 1
